We'll implement a Progressive Web App (PWA) approach as it provides:
- The most value within budget constraints
- Cross-platform compatibility (iOS and Android)
- No app store submission requirements
- App-like experience with home screen installation

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Add PWA Essentials

- Generate app icons in various sizes
- Implement service workers for caching
- Configure offline fallback pages

### 2. Mobile UI Optimization

- Configure A2HS (Add to Home Screen) behavior
- Create splash screens for app launch

### 5. Performance Optimization
